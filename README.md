 Your mission is to hit your opponent with the exploding banana
 by varying the angle and power of your throw, taking into account
 wind speed, gravity, and the city skyline.

 Speed of this game is determined by the constant SPEEDCONST.  If the

 program is too slow or too fast adjust the "CONST SPEEDCONST = 500" line
 below.  The larger the number the faster the game will go.
