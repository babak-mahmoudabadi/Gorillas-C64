# Gorillas-C64

I recently acquired a C64, the legendary 8-bit computer from the 80s.  Even after more than two decades, my programs on the cassette tape ran flawlessly. Among them, I discovered some unfinished projects that I had abandoned long ago, such as Gorillas, a classic game of throwing bananas at each other. I decided to resume my work on them. After all, there is no greater satisfaction than completing an unfinished project. ;)
